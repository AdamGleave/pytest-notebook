A pytest plugin for testing Jupyter Notebooks

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) plugin was generated
with [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) along with
[\@hackebrot](https://github.com/hackebrot)\'s
[cookiecutter-pytest-plugin](https://github.com/pytest-dev/cookiecutter-pytest-plugin)
template.

Features
--------

-   Clear API

Note: Could use https://github.com/computationalmodelling/nbval,
but this treats the whole notebook file as the test file, so doesn't allow
programmatic access to the file before/after testing.
